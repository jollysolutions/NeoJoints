## What are these?
NeoJoints make it easy to solder together pieces of WS2812 / NeoPixel-style
LED strip.

NeoJoints have the following features
* Available in multiple angles
* Solderable holes for adding additional power at joints
* Cuttable trace on data line for separating strips logically
* Mounting hole for 2-56 screw
* Single-sided millable on PCB mill like Othermill,
    with a single 1/32" endmill (though adding 1/8" to cleanup helps)

## How to Solder

* Step 1: Get NeoJoint and LED strip pieces laid out correctly
  - Be sure to make sure data arrows are pointing correctly

* Step 2: Turn over strips, put small solder blobs on *back* of each pad
  - Depending on the strip, you may need to scratch away adhesive layer or waterproofing

* Step 3: Lay strip on top of NeoJoint, then heat up with soldering iron to melt solder blobs, one by one
  - Take care to keep strip aligned when melting first solder blob

* Step 4: Continue until you've soldered down all points
  - You can look along the side of the strip to see if the solder has melted
  - And you can see if you have any solder bridges
